# Async workshop

> Asynchronous programming in Node

## Set up

```
git clone https://github.com/bbc/async-workshop
```

## Workshop
This is a **self paced** workshop which allows developers to enhance asynchronous programming knowledge by solving coding challenges and refactoring applications/libraries. 

**This is not a tutorial or lecture based workshop**. However, the workshop will provide
references to any required resources.

By doing a workshop on asynchronous programming in Node 8, we aim to achieve:

* Gain familarity with async and await constructs
* Gain familarity with the Promise API
* Advantages/disadvantages of promises and async/await
* Recognising (or defining) when to use promises and async/await
* Asynchronous patters eg filter, map, reduce, retries, error handling
* Define consistent ways of writing async code in Node 8
* Increase knowledge via practical application
* Share ideas/views with other team members

We will **not** been focusing on generators for this workshop. 

## Instructions 
    * Read the questions carefully. 
    * Some exercises have tests but not all. Typically you don't need to worry about the tests unless instructed.  
    * DO NOT change the tests. Report any issues.
    * DO NOT cheat the tests (pointless) i.e return hardcoded values to make them pass. 
    * Use referenced resources for assistance.
    * Answer the questions in order (optional but recommended)
    * You can skip questions
    * Work individually (recommended) unless instructed (there is a pairing exercise).
